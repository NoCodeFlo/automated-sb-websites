You are an experienced senior web designer and mentor.

You are reviewing the following detailed analysis of a website (its purpose, structure, content, design elements, color schemes, etc.).

Your task is to generate a clear, structured and actionable prompt for a **junior web developer** who will be responsible for rebuilding this website.

The new version of the site should:
- Reuse the **existing content** (text, structure, purpose)
- Not come up with new content that is fully made up
- Stay consistent with the **existing design language** (e.g., colors, layout, mood)
- Apply **modern web design best practices** for usability, accessibility, responsiveness, and simplicity
- Result in a **visually improved, more user-friendly version** of the original site
- If there are any pages linking to social media (Instagram, Facebook), include the existing external link on the website, but don't try to rebuild any of the social media pages

Make sure your developer prompt includes:
1. The URL of the website that will be rebuilt
2. An overview of the project and goals
3. A section-by-section breakdown of what the developer should implement for each page
4. When mentioning images, provide the direct URL to the hosted image if possible (only if it exists)
5. Specific frontend technologies or frameworks to consider (optional)
6. Any constraints or important content that must not be changed
7. Tone and feel of the new design (e.g., modern, clean, warm, etc.)
8. Deliverables: focus on the design and implementation of the page and do not specifically mention any plugins, configurations or creation of README documentation

Below is the original website analysis:

PAGE ANALYSIS: https://www.pures-leben.ch/

1) Page URL
- https://www.pures-leben.ch/

2) Purpose of the page
- This is a Cloudflare “Just a moment…” human-verification interstitial (Turnstile challenge). It is not the actual website homepage content. The purpose is to verify the visitor before allowing access to the real site.

3) Overall layout and page sections
- Main wrapper (role="main")
  - Container “main-content”
    - Site identifier heading
    - Instructional subheading prompting human verification
    - Cloudflare Turnstile widget area (empty placeholder in the HTML; rendered by script)
    - Loading spinner (hidden by default)
    - Core message explaining that the site needs to review the connection
    - Success message area (hidden by default) with “Verification successful” and “Waiting for www.pures-leben.ch to respond...”
    - Noscript fallback instruction to enable JavaScript and cookies
- Footer
  - Diagnostic wrapper showing Ray ID
  - Attribution: “Performance & security by Cloudflare”

4) Main headings (h1–h6)
- h1: “www.pures-leben.ch”
- h2: “Verify you are human by completing the action below.”
- h2 (hidden until success): “Verification successful”
- h2 (noscript fallback): “Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue”

5) Text content (exact copy from the HTML)
- “www.pures-leben.ch”
- “Verify you are human by completing the action below.”
- “www.pures-leben.ch needs to review the security of your connection before proceeding.”
- “Verification successful”
- “Waiting for www.pures-leben.ch to respond...”
- “Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue”
- Footer:
  - “Ray ID: 9708ad504e0fb654”
  - “Performance & security by Cloudflare” (with “Cloudflare” linked to https://www.cloudflare.com?utm_source=challenge&utm_campaign=m)

6) Image content (links and alt)
- No traditional <img> tags are present.
- CSS background icons (inline SVG via data URLs) are used for:
  - Success icon (checkmark in a circle) attached to #challenge-success-text
  - Error/notice icon (exclamation) attached to #challenge-error-text
- Alt text: No alt text available.
- Hosted image links: Not applicable; the icons are inline data URIs embedded in CSS.

7) Primary and secondary colors (observed in inline styles/CSS)
- Text/base:
  - #313131 (default text on light theme)
  - #fff (light theme background)
  - #222 (dark theme background)
  - #d9d9d9 (borders/light gray elements)
- Links and buttons (light theme):
  - #0051c3 (link color; button background/border in default state)
  - #003681 (button hover/active state)
  - #ee730a (link hover accent)
- Alerts/accents:
  - #fc574a (error icon color in light theme)
  - #b20f03 (red tone in dark theme)
  - #4693ff (button color in dark theme)
  - #595959 and #999 (spinner/loader ring colors)

Notes for rebuilding
- The page captured is the Cloudflare challenge screen, not the real homepage. There is no discoverable brand content, navigation, imagery, or business text to reuse from the actual site.
- To proceed with a faithful rebuild of site pages, you will need either:
  - Access past the Cloudflare challenge (IP allowlist or a shareable preview/link after verification), or
  - An export of site content (text, images, styles) from the CMS or a design handoff.
- If you want to recreate the verification experience itself, you can implement a similar layout:
  - Large site identifier (h1) with domain name
  - Subheading instructing verification
  - Turnstile widget area
  - Spinner for pending state
  - Success message and waiting notice
  - Footer with diagnostic token and “Performance & security by Cloudflare”
  - Use the color palette above for a similar look and feel.
