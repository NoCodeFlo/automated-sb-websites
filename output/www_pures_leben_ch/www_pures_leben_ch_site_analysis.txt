PAGE ANALYSIS: https://www.pures-leben.ch/

1) Page URL
- https://www.pures-leben.ch/

  - Container “main-content”
    - Site identifier heading
    - Instructional subheading prompting human verification

    - Loading spinner (hidden by default)
    - Core message explaining that the site needs to review the connection
    - Success message area (hidden by default) with “Verification successful” and “Waiting for www.pures-leben.ch to respond...”
    - Noscript fallback instruction to enable JavaScript and cookies
- Footer
  - Diagnostic wrapper showing Ray ID
  - Attribution: “Performance & security by Cloudflare”

4) Main headings (h1–h6)
- h1: “www.pures-leben.ch”
- h2: “Verify you are human by completing the action below.”
- h2 (hidden until success): “Verification successful”
- h2 (noscript fallback): “Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue”

5) Text content (exact copy from the HTML)
- “www.pures-leben.ch”
- “Verify you are human by completing the action below.”
- “www.pures-leben.ch needs to review the security of your connection before proceeding.”
- “Verification successful”
- “Waiting for www.pures-leben.ch to respond...”
- “Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue”
- Footer:
  - “Ray ID: 9708ad504e0fb654”
  - “Performance & security by Cloudflare” (with “Cloudflare” linked to https://www.cloudflare.com?utm_source=challenge&utm_campaign=m)

6) Image content (links and alt)
- No traditional <img> tags are present.
- CSS background icons (inline SVG via data URLs) are used for:
  - Success icon (checkmark in a circle) attached to #challenge-success-text
  - Error/notice icon (exclamation) attached to #challenge-error-text
- Alt text: No alt text available.
- Hosted image links: Not applicable; the icons are inline data URIs embedded in CSS.

7) Primary and secondary colors (observed in inline styles/CSS)
- Text/base:
  - #313131 (default text on light theme)
  - #fff (light theme background)
  - #222 (dark theme background)
  - #d9d9d9 (borders/light gray elements)
- Links and buttons (light theme):
  - #0051c3 (link color; button background/border in default state)

Notes for rebuilding
- The page captured is the Cloudflare challenge screen, not the real homepage. There is no discoverable brand content, navigation, imagery, or business text to reuse from the actual site.
- To proceed with a faithful rebuild of site pages, you will need either:
  - Access past the Cloudflare challenge (IP allowlist or a shareable preview/link after verification), or
  - An export of site content (text, images, styles) from the CMS or a design handoff.
- If you want to recreate the verification experience itself, you can implement a similar layout:
  - Large site identifier (h1) with domain name
  - Subheading instructing verification
  - Turnstile widget area
  - Spinner for pending state
  - Success message and waiting notice
  - Footer with diagnostic token and “Performance & security by Cloudflare”
  - Use the color palette above for a similar look and feel.
